# Oxford_AI_School_Projects

## Introduction

Welcome to the README for my projects from the AI school. In this school, I had the opportunity to work on three distinct projects, each tackling different aspects of machine learning. I utilized Python and the PyTorch library as my primary tools for these projects, and all the code implementations and analysis are my own. Additionally, I completed these projects using Google Colab, a cloud-based platform for collaborative Python programming and machine learning.

## Project 1: Biker Count Prediction

In this project, I used Linear Regression to approximate the number of bikers based on a wide range of measurements. Additionally, I delved into examining how the amount of data, particularly high-correlation data, impacted the loss function.

**Key Points:**
- Implemented Linear Regression for biker count prediction.
- Explored the impact of high-correlation data on model performance.

## Project 2: Housing Price Prediction and Point Classification

### Subproject 2.1: Housing Price Prediction

In the first part of this project, I used a simple neural network with fixed hyperparameters to predict housing prices.

**Key Points:**
- Implemented a neural network for housing price prediction.
- Utilized fixed hyperparameters for model training.

### Subproject 2.2: Point Classification

In the second part of this project, I focused on classifying points on a plane into three different classes. To achieve this, I initially implemented two distinct approaches: logistic regression and a neural network with fixed hyperparameters. Subsequently, I ventured into the realm of hyperparameter tuning, not only fine-tuning standard parameters like learning rate and epochs but also exploring more advanced adjustments. This involved creating a customized neural network with a different number of layers and varying sizes to optimize the model's performance.

**Key Points:**
- Employed logistic regression for point classification.
- Implemented a neural network with fixed hyperparameters.
- Demonstrated the impact of hyperparameter tuning on the classification task.

## Project 3: CIFAR-10 Image Classification

In the third project, I tackled image classification using various deep learning models. I started with a simple neural network, progressed to a convolutional neural network (CNN), and finally fine-tuned the ResNet18 model to classify CIFAR-10 images.

**Key Points:**
- Employed a neural network for image classification.
- Utilized a convolutional neural network (CNN) for improved performance.
- Demonstrated the process of fine-tuning the ResNet18 model for CIFAR-10 classification.

## Conclusion

These projects allowed me to gain valuable hands-on experience in different aspects of machine learning, from linear regression to deep convolutional neural networks. I hope you find this README helpful in understanding the scope and details of each project. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out.
